Dash Online Data Science Dashboard using Plotly
A Python project to analyse Facebook Stock Market performance and its key metrics
In this project I created an online dashboard to interactively analyse and visualize two different datasets.

The first dataset is about stock prices. In this Dashboard, I an fact compare Facebook stock market performances with other companies such as Tesla, Microsoft and Apple.

The second dataset used to analyse Facebook Performance Metrics (eg. likes per post, paid vs free posts distributions)

Additionally, a Machine Learning approach to analyse these two datasets is proposed.

This dashboard can be tested live using this link http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
